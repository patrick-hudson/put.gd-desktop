# Implementation evidence

Evidence below records observed checks, not the remaining release scope. The full
contract is [issue #1](https://github.com/patrick-hudson/put.gd-desktop/issues/1).

| Unit / slice | Observed evidence | Remaining gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| U1 bootstrap | Mint 22.3, GCC 13.3, Qt 6.4.2, QtKeychain 0.14.2; AWS 1.11.907 plus 15 pinned submodules built; Debug contracts and no-test Release build passed; ASan/UBSan contracts passed outside process sandbox | Authored CI jobs have not run on Ubuntu 26.04, Windows, or macOS |
| U2 shared services | Test-first service failures and returned/stored regressions; all 11 current executables pass Debug (16.47s) and ASan/UBSan with leak checking (37.67s); no-test Release builds; actual resident socket/CLI, asynchronous settings, manifest recovery, bounded acquisition/retry, opaque receipts/deletion, previews and 10,000-record history tested | Literal full-filesystem archive failure awaits the lab; GUI binding and production adapters belong to later units. TSan builds, but cannot initialize on this host |
| U3 S3 | SDK serializes conditional headers in a local test | Signed requests, full offline fixture, secrets, synthetic destination acceptance and all deletion cases |
| U4–U10 | Not implemented or verified yet | Native workflows, UI/history, real desktop lab, GNOME/KDE adapters, MCP, packaging and release evidence |

Configuration tests cover fresh setup without an implicit cloud profile, private atomic
writes, stale revisions, retained accepted settings after malformed/missing/oversized files,
repeated external replacements, actual periodic discovery when the parent directory was
initially missing, own-write notification deduplication, strict root types/keys/references,
cooperative lock contention, nullable patch values, and an unwritable parent directory.
All use temporary synthetic configuration; they access no clipboard, screen, cloud,
or secret store. Offscreen tests are not compositor acceptance evidence.

U2 operation tests use synthetic native/provider seams. They cover MIME precedence,
empty/inaccessible batch rejection before publication, content-based category routing,
atomic unique archives, archive retry without reupload, same-batch collision handling,
unknown publication/restart, original settings/destination snapshots, and clipboard
ownership/ticket arbitration. A committed private manifest recovers the file/SQL crash
window without publishing; abandoned staging is removed only after journal ownership
is acquired. A second resident cannot recover or remove the first resident's work.

History tests cover indexed pages/filters over 10,000 entries, transactional migration
and rollback, remote-management fields surviving operation updates, and cleared entries
staying cleared. Deletion uses original opaque receipts and durable step checkpoints.
The shutdown test drains the first sent DELETE and leaves the second target pending;
exactly one DELETE occurs. Real owner-only Unix-socket tests run outside the process
sandbox's socket restriction, with bounded versioned JSON and the built CLI executable.

Three simplification reviewers found four unique changes: reuse terminal-state checks,
avoid duplicate MIME reads and item serialization, and release unused object locks.
The lock-lifetime test first failed, then passed after replacing retained strong references
with weak references; active holders/waiters still share the same mutex. An additional
regression first accepted an own-publication receipt for a different destination;
reconciliation now retains unknown status and the original candidate instead.
The compiler build and whitespace check pass; no separate lint tool is configured.

The selected TSan operation, deletion, configuration-reload, and settings executables
compile, but each exits before tests with `ThreadSanitizer: unexpected memory mapping`.
This is a runtime compatibility limitation, not a passing race check. A compatible
TSan environment remains a release gate. Distro Qt and the separately built SDK are
not sanitizer-instrumented; ASan/UBSan covers app-owned code.

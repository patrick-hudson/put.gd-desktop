# Native acceptance driver hardening (#495) — 2026-10-24

This is the documentation companion to the maintained driver in
`tools/lab/native_acceptance.py`. Merge the code PR before this documentation PR.
The [structured record](summary.json) distinguishes historical observations,
driver checks and exact-build desktop evidence. Results are pending; this record
does not establish a new native-package or release acceptance pass.

## Historical evidence and its limits

The [2026-10-23 native-package pass](../2026-10-23-native-full-acceptance/README.md)
tested `v26.1023.1058-nightly`, source `05991d9d`. Its drivers, result files and
visuals remain historical inputs. [Issue #495](https://github.com/patrick-hudson/put.gd-desktop/issues/495)
records six findings from that pass:

| Finding | What the old run proved or exposed | Required replacement evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tray target | The tint finder selected taskbar/panel items. k72 entered panel edit mode; m74 opened Add a new panel. Both were cancelled and panel settings were unchanged. | Resolve the registered StatusNotifierItem by explicit resident PID, exact executable and expected title. Use its D-Bus actions and owned dbusmenu's dynamically discovered exact Quit action. Reject coordinates and `TRAY_XY`. |
| Plasma session/cache | d69 lacked even Dolphin in its application cache; rebuilding sycoca in plasmashell's environment restored discovery and capture. | Identify the current graphical session and cache health; retain any refusal, repair and recheck. A generic SSH environment is insufficient. |
| Login start | An SSH-started `systemd-run --user` resident can survive graphical logout while the user manager remains alive. Early attempts therefore did not prove a new login start. | Record and quit the exact owned resident before logout. Bind before/after evidence to the real graphical session, boot and process start identities. |
| Removal and autostart | The old snapshot crashed after the CLI was purged; the first plasmashell PID could belong to the previous login. | Take removal-tolerant snapshots and compare the actual current session, including no resident after removal and a real login. CLI absence is an observed state, not a successful CLI query. |
| History shape | Migration preserved 10,000 entries copied into five operations. The UI grouped 2,000 files as one capture. | Seed distinct operations with consistent entry relationships and verify the resulting operation/entry counts and realistic History grouping. Old timings do not measure that new workload. |
| Keychain lifecycle | M1 uploads used session credentials; a second profile preserved a keychain reference and reported `credential_setup_required`. | Prove actual keychain write/read/use across restart or login with an unlocked backend. A retained reference, session credentials or a locked-backend refusal cannot establish this lifecycle. |

The old outcome tables and failure context are unchanged. In particular, the m74
P failure (#490) remains a failure in that record. Later host setup or driver fixes
do not retroactively turn those attempts into passes.

## Maintained commands

Use the code PR's `tools/lab/native_acceptance.py`, starting with
`python3 tools/lab/native_acceptance.py --help`. The exact interface and checked
commands will be recorded here when the implementation stabilizes.

The maintained tool covers the focused #495 checks. It does not establish a
complete A–Q package campaign by itself; a future campaign still needs reviewed
orchestration for the remaining scenarios and exact-asset evidence.

The old `nfa.py` pass-through, `nk.sh`, `find-tray`, tint/coordinate tray activation
and `quit-tray` recipes are retired for new campaigns. Do not use `--x`, `--y` or
`TRAY_XY` as an escape hatch. The preserved [old driver guide](../2026-10-23-native-full-acceptance/lab/README.md)
explains the 1058 run; it is not the current runbook.

Before any isolated Linux launch, use a fresh short private output/runtime path
and check every complete socket path, including `putgd/session.sock`, with
`python3 tools/diagnostics/check_socket_paths.py --socket COMPLETE_PATH` (or
`--ui-output` for UI-harness output directories). Reject paths over 107 UTF-8
bytes before launch. Follow [remote-builder locking and visibility](../../remote-builders.md)
and [VM lifecycle rules](../../vm-lab.md). This documentation thread runs no GUI
campaign; the code owner coordinates execution and desktop locks.

## Results and prerequisites

Exact driver commit, tested application identities, commands, sanitized results,
saved visual hashes and cleanup receipts are pending from the code owner. Raw
bulk artifacts stay private. A driver unit test or D-Bus action result alone
does not prove visible tray behavior or a real logout/login.

The original keychain problem described the 2026-10-23 pass. The later
[builder lab-keyring setup](../../remote-builders.md#proton-sessions-on-the-builders)
records default lab keyrings on all four hosts. Inspect their current availability
and use an isolated test entry; do not infer a put.gd keychain lifecycle pass from
that setup or modify existing Proton sessions. Record locked/missing backends as
prerequisites until the real lifecycle is exercised.
